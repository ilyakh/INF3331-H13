The solidpython-elements package is a constructive solid geometry toolkit
based on solidpython and OpenSCAD.

The main goal of The Elements is to structure and rationalize the typical design
workflow.

All workflows are separated into three stages:
1. Create all solid elements (children of Body) (create())
2. Create all hull elements (children of Space) (create())
3. Position the elements in the space (put())

These happens part-wise: each part goes through the same order of assembly.
